Assuming you had the chance of being on this earth for some time, you’ll know beyond doubt that this version of the world we live in is the most advanced and most different in terms of information flow and how it affects everything around us. But somethings haven’t changed. And the well documented Israeli occupation of Palestine, referred to by some as the The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, is definitely one of them. Something that led to the emergence of Hamas as a resistance move. Soon after, Hamas made it to the United States list of terrorist organization, reinforcing the U.S. long standing policy toward the middle east.

But where does that leave Twitter? It's a very interesting question to ask and quite frankly not the easiest to answer specially when you consider that the US, UK, Israel and EU are, unsurprisingly, the most prominent names when it comes to designating Hamas a terrorist group, the same group that had a stunning victory in the Palestinian elections back in 2006 and is widely perceived as the only military resistance on the Palestinian side.

**Two things:**

1. Twitter is a platform with a very distinctive theme that gives it its unique status among social giants.
2. It operates on U.S. soil, a fact that contributes heavily to its existence and its unique theme.

With these in mind it becomes easier to answer the question of why Hamas leader gets to stay while Trump’s account is permanently suspended.

### **A Promise**

What makes Twitter the platform it’s today is a promise, the promise of a free platform where ideas and opinions are freely exchanged which in turn leads to conversations about the most controversial topics. The social media company even allows nudity which is unheard of in the social space.

It’s a platform for everyone and Twitter can’t afford to be picky about who says what or who stays otherwise they will be compromising on their promise, the very reason behind their prominence and most importantly their existence.

They have to operate in the light of their terms and conditions even if it means controversy every once in a while.

We have seen bans from all kinds on Twitter whether it’s hate speech or incitement to violence and [these bans are still going](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-bans-indian-actress-violating-hate-abuse-rules-2021-05-04/). But where to draw the line? This becomes even more trickier in the case of politicians. No moderation and it’s a Armageddon. Silence too many voices and Twitter ceases from existence whether by no longer becoming the go-to platform for expression or by angering those world leaders and governments, the ones for which the platform tailored a specific set of features. This is by no means in defense of Twitter but then again, it’s complicated.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact Twitter allows the leader of the Hamas terrorist group on the platform but bans so many conservatives is completely insane <a href="https://t.co/aXURPC9nAM">pic.twitter.com/aXURPC9nAM</a></p>&mdash; Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1392628566915944448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Just as the situation between Hamas and the IDF was evolving, various conservatives tweeted questioning Twitter’s decisions while expressing their desire for Hamas leader to be removed from the platform. The tweet in question doesn’t exist anymore, but taking a look at the man’s account, you’ll find that he uses it mainly for mourning and reporting and in this tweet he emphasizes that there is no cease fire and escalation is the choice between two sides that are technically at war. How does that fare in Twitter’s book? Given that the account is still up, the answer is clear.

But to think Twitter is giving preferential treatment here, you couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, Twitter gave exceptions to use even worse and more explicitly aggressive language in the past to one man in far less similar situations. You guessed it, this man is Donald Trump. Until something very unusual happened.

### **Land of The Free**

While Twitter can handle the technical side that makes it a key player in the social media realm, there is something that goes beyond them: the laws of the country that hold their business and have a direct effect on their present and future.

We are well aware of Trump’s actions before leaving office and saying that his total shut down is merely a move in a series of back-and-forth jabs between Republicans and Democrats doesn’t even count as an act of oversimplification and is downright misleading.

In the events of storming the US Capitol, Trump was not only inciting violence, supporting white supremacists, and staging a coup, but in succeeding to do so he is threatening the core of what makes the U.S. the largest business in the world: its _democracy_. Specially when you factor in his [blatant support for dictators](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-wheres-my-favorite-dictator-884509/) and palpable inclination toward dictatorship. And how outspoken he was against social media companies and his desire to regulate them under different category of the law.

Again, it’s not a simple equation with a known verifiable outcome, but it could be a start to set things in motion for the worst. As a business, you don’t even want to imagine the U.S. without its democracy, let alone one that mainly operates on the principle of freedom of speech.

##### **In the end ..**

Presidents and politicians don’t need a social media account to announce a decision or wage a war because in the end people are the ones who will be voicing their message and media agencies will be racing to report the news du jour which will eventually end up on those platforms. It’s the likes of Twitter, at the very least, and Facebook who need this type of content not the other way around.
