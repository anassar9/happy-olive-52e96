You are in the personal zone of Ahmed R. Nassar. Scientist, blogger, and creator.

Having obtained my bachelor's degree in [Biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics), it's safe to say that my educational background falls perfectly in line with my versatile lifestyle.

This versatility in interests along with my curiosity and desire to build helped me create more interests and pick up new skills along the way to achieving whatever comes to my mind.

And with the computer being of my very first fascinations, coding is definitely on the list. Have a look!

     person = 'baby'
     relationship = (input('relationship good?'))
     
     if person == 'baby' and relationship == 'yes':
        print('oh,baby')
        
     else: 
        print('oops, mademoiselle!')
